# To Do List Node/Express Project Using MongoDB

Following Angela Yu's web developement course. Created a To Do List Web Application using Javascript, Node, Express and EJS.
The app is connected to a NoSQL Mongo database and uses mongoose. Items in the to do list can be added or deleted. The items are stored 
in the mongo database and then removed once deleted.
